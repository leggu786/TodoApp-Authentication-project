# TodoApp-Authentication-project
Todo Backend Application with Authentication
Introduction
This project is a comprehensive backend application for managing todo lists, complete with user authentication and authorization. Developed using Node.js and Express, it provides a robust and scalable foundation for building a full-fledged todo management system. MongoDB is used as the database to store user credentials and todo items, ensuring efficient and flexible data management. JWT (JSON Web Token) is employed to secure the API endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated users can perform actions on their todo lists.

Key Features
User Authentication:

Sign-Up: Users can create an account by providing a username and password.
Sign-In: Users can log in using their credentials, receiving a JWT token for authenticated access.
JWT-Based Authentication:

Secure endpoints with JWT to ensure that only authenticated users can access and modify their todo lists.
Middleware to validate JWT tokens in incoming requests.
Todo CRUD Operations:

Create: Authenticated users can create new todo items.
Read: Users can retrieve their todo items, either as a list or individually by ID.
Update: Users can update the details of their todo items.
Delete: Users can delete their todo items.
Search and Pagination:

Search: Users can search their todo items based on title or description.
Pagination: API supports pagination to handle large sets of todo items efficiently.
Favorite Todo Items:

Users can mark todo items as favorites to easily identify important tasks.
Technologies Used
Node.js: A powerful JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user credentials and todo items.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
JWT (JSON Web Token): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
Project Structure
index.js: The main entry point of the application, setting up routes and middleware.
jwt-token.js: Contains functions for generating and validating JWT tokens.
models/user.js: Defines the User schema and model for MongoDB.
models/todo.js: Defines the Todo schema and model for MongoDB.
API Endpoints
User Authentication:

POST /signup: Create a new user account.
POST /signin: Authenticate a user and generate a JWT token.
Todo Management:

POST /todos: Create a new todo item.
PUT /todos/
: Update an existing todo item.
DELETE /todos/
: Delete a todo item.
GET /todos: Retrieve a paginated list of todo items.
GET /todos/
: Retrieve a specific todo item by ID.
GET /search: Search for todo items based on a query string.
Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:

Once the server is running, you can use tools like Postman to interact with the API endpoints for signing up, signing in, and managing todo items.

Conclusion
This project provides a solid foundation for building a todo management application with user authentication. The use of JWT ensures secure access to the API, and MongoDB offers a scalable solution for data storage. The structured approach to CRUD operations, along with search and pagination, makes this application both efficient and user-friendly.
